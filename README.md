Description:

A beginner-friendly image classification project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras, trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model classifies images into 10 categories such as airplane, cat, truck, etc. This project focuses on building, training, and evaluating a CNN model from scratch.

Key Features:

> Loads and preprocesses CIFAR-10 image dataset
> Builds a simple CNN using convolution, pooling, and dense layers
> Trains the model and evaluates accuracy on test data
> Visualizes training vs. validation accuracy
> Displays sample image predictions with actual and predicted labels
